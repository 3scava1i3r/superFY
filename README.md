# superFY
The main idea is to create a fixed yield platform that provides yield in form of superfluid streams and have start a new phase in defi on top of superfluid streams


- The yield is on top of aave/compound markets(pools) on polygon testnet(dunno if they even have sopmething like this hahagha)
- also if i have time i’ll have small spaceship game on top of this which is a combination of defi and nfts? like fixed stream bearing nfts → game is somewhat like aavegotchi
